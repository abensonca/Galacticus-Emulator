    "# Galacticus Subhalo Population Emulation Using Normalizing Flows\n",
    "\n",
    "Goal is to emulate the PDF of the Galacticus-predicted subhalo population using normalizing flows. This will allow for rapid generation of realizations of subhalo populations (as normalizing flows are invertible and can thereby be used as generative models). By emulating all properties required to fully define each subhalo, the resulting emulator could be used to generate a realization which is then processed through Galacticus to construct detailed density profiles etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach is closely based on that describe [here](https://keras.io/examples/generative/real_nvp/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Some caveats:\n",
    "1. This approach will not reproduce any correlations between subhalos (which may arise due to mass conservation constraints for example);\n",
    "2. We currently ignore the subhalo hierarchy (i.e. all subhalos are subhalos, there are no sub-subhalos);"
